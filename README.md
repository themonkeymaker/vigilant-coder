First Project is to create a memory card game following the below criteria.

Flash-Cards
Pre-load your app with some data, and let the user flip through them quickly (back or front), 
and use the keyboard flip the card, and to mark whether they got it right or not. Track which 
cards were incorrect, and re-display them until the user gets them right!

Bonus:

Track scores over time (even if the page is reloaded)
Include images on one or both sides of the flash card
Let the user add flash cards (don't need to be saved across refreshes)
